# Q3 Project Description

## Who Uses It?

This is an application for friends, family, neighbors  alike that want to be able to create an event at their house and notify others / check-in or see who is currently checked-in. Right now, this project is on a smaller scale and will be used for three different "home bars" (Gonzo's, Manhattons, Bario) on Manhatton Street and their friends/family.

## What Outputs Do They Need?

* People who have checked-in, which home bar is open, posts/comments and uploaded photos.

## What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?

* Lower tiers: form to enter name for check-in, posts
* Upper tiers: User authentication to login & 'open' their bar. Full CRUD functionality for checked in users, posts/comments/photos

## A list of technologies that you plan to use

* Express
* React
* Redux
* Node
* Knex
* Postico
* SQL
* PG
* Body-Parser

## A well-defined and written-out feature list

* Lower tiers can post comments/upload photos and see other's comments, view which home bar is open, check-in at a home bar and see who has checked in.
* Higher tiers have the same feature list as lower tiers as well as 'opening' their bar, full CRUD functionality for checked in users and comments.
